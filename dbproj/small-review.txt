Andrew O'Hehir	TRUE	Salon.com	Fresh		2010-09-03	"It's a solid but totally forgettable entertainment, redeemed somewhat by Barrymore's loud, horsey laugh and some agreeably racy comic situations."	"Erin (Drew Barrymore) and Garrett (Justin Long) are very much in love. When Erin moves to San Francisco to finish her journalism degree and Garrett stays behind in New York to work in the music industry, they gamely keep the romance alive with webcams and frequent-flyer miles. But just when it seems the lovers will soon be reunited, they each score a big break that could separate them for good."
